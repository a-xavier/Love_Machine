--> Add Avatars for players
--> To avoid lagging the first time a scene loads -> add after the splashscreen a scene named loadscene where we generate a mega global array containing all big ressources (like audio) then ffrom each scene we reference those like megaarray.boomsound or megaarray[23]
--> Add a unique selectable minigame.
